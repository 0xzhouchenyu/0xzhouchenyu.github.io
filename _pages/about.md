Hi :wave: , This is Chenyu (周宸宇 in Chinese)!

I am currently a first-year PhD student in Institute of Intelligent Computing at Shanghai Jiao Tong University. I'm very proud to be advised by [Prof. Yinyu Ye](https://web.stanford.edu/~yyye/) and [Prof. Dongdong Ge](https://web.stanford.edu/~yyye/). Prior to this, I obtained my bachelar’s degree from [China University of Petroleum, Beijing](https://www.cup.edu.cn/) and my master's degree from [The Chinese University of Hong Kong, Shenzhen](https://www.cuhk.edu.cn/), where I was advised by [Prof. Wei Cai](https://faculty.washington.edu/weicaics/).

I am deeply passionate about the intersection of technology and finance, and firmly believe that technology-driven finance will revolutionize the financial industry. **Specifically, my research interests center on the application of artificial intelligence (large language models, deep learning and machine learning) and blockchain (decentralized computing, smart contract and cryptocurrency) in finance.**

I possess strong programming skills and take pleasure in coding. I am a gold medalist in the Asian regional contest of the [International Collegiate Programming Contest](https://icpc.global/)(ACM-ICPC).

I like conducting my research in real industrial settings. I have served as an AI researcher at [Cardinal Operations](https://www.shanshu.ai/)(杉数科技), [Tencent](https://www.tencent.com/en-us/)(腾讯), and [Meituan](https://www.meituan.com/)(美团).

I have a strong passion for quantitative investment. I have nearly two years of full-time or internship work experience before pursuing my master degree. My previous employers include [Ubiquant Investment](https://www.ubiquant.com/)(九坤投资), [Harvest Fund](https://www.jsfund.cn/)(嘉实基金), and [JZL Capital](https://www.jzlcapital.xyz/)(君理资本).

I was obsessed with business competitions for a long time. I led our team to the 7th place in China in the [Global Management Challenge](https://globalmanagementchallenge.com/) in 2021.
